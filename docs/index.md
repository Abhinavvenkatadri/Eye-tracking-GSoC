# Gazetrack

This provides the complete guide to trying to improve the current eye trackers by implementing and tuning the previous year’s implementation of the eye trackers.We follow Google’s implementation of the Paper titled “ Accelerating eye movement research via accurate and affordable smartphone eye tracking” and going into much depth of their implementation

# Introduction

It has varieties of applications ranging across usability and user experience research, gaming, driving, and gaze-based interaction for accessibility to healthcare. Smartphone gaze could also provide a digital phenotype for screening or monitoring health conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, concussion and more. This could enable timely and early interventions, especially for countries with limited access to healthcare services. People with conditions such as ALS, locked-in syndrome and stroke have impaired speech and motor ability. The smartphone gaze could provide a powerful way to make daily tasks easier with the use of gaze for interaction, as recently demonstrated by Google Look to Speak.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
